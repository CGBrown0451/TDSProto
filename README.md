# Top Down Shooter Prototype
Started 29/10/2018: This is a small prototype for a Twin-Stick Top Down Shooter, inspired by [Smash TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_TV), an arcade game from 1990. I plan to have movement, shooting and multiple enemy types by the end of development of this project on the 14th of November, 2018, but I may end up scoping down. 

The target for this game is a web page with raw javascript on a desktop. This is a limitation of my game, so I need to be more creative.
